"To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively
conscious is to be in a state of rage almost, almost
all of the time--and in one's work. And part fo the
rage is this: It isn't only what is happening to you.
But it's what's happening all around you and all of
the time in the face of the most extraordinary and
criminal indifference, indifference of most white
people in this country."
